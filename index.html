                i can't speak<br>
                Your voice is so low<br>
                My sister said<br>
                I think Hatice was talking to Richard on the balcony<br>
                I said<br>
                We read the Quran together<br>
                I didn't tell anything about you<br>
                My mom always says Curly boy?<br>
                İ said noo<br>
                Soo <br>
                They didn't know that you were a Muslim and they were surprised<br>
                They said a lot of things<br>
                My daddy is kidding now and says<br>
                Already away. No problem. <br>
                My sister says. <br>
                What if he comes to Turkey?<br>
                Then we lock it in the room <br>
                :sweat_smile::sweat_smile::sweat_smile:<br>
                I say<br>
                He is not my boyfriend. Don't worry.<br>
                I don't remember now<br>
                Then they said something<br>
                I don't remember<br>
                I was drinking water at that moment<br>
                Water came back from my nose<br>
                My mom says. Okay. Richard is now my son<br>
                Mom, don't be silly, I say enough. She doesn't understand.<br>
                Then my sister says seriously(!)<br>
                Oh sister. I will cry for you. There is no remote distance relationship. Do not be sad. I find you a very handsome person<br>
                I said <br>
                Okayyy enoughhhhhhhhhh<br>
                They are all kidding<br>
                I said to my mom<br>
                Richard celebrating your Mother's day<br>
                Then my mother turned to my big sister<br>
                (My older sister has a boyfriend)<br>
                Yours did not celebrate my mothers day. But Richard. Well done. Now he is my son<br>
                It was like theater<br>
                It was extremely funny<br></p>

                i'm going to destroy the forest<br><br>
    
                come on you're with us now <br><br>
    
                i had the most messed up dream<br><br>
    
                there were talking slugs and tiny little soldiers<br><br>
    
                great moments t born from great opportunities<br><br>
    
                you shouldn't have any doubt in your mind about what you supposed to do tonight<br><br>
    
                and about how u r supposed to do it<br><br>
    
                i don't want them to gain another yard <br><br>
    
                that's how wining is done <br><br>
    
                we r going to go out there and we are going to take their game<br> and shove it-
                -right back in their face.<br><br>
    
                we got to go, and we got to take it <br><br>

                i will ask u one last time to be the best u can be <br><br>
    
                it's about heart it'a about who will go out there and play the hardest,<br>
                it's about how hard you can get hit and keep moving forward.<br><br>
    
                and i guarantee a week won't go by in ur life, u won't regret,<br>
                walking out letting them get the best of u. <br><br><br>

                Grammar<br>
                at the beginning:<br>
                I wanna tell u that all what u need to know now from the grammar is the-
                -simple tenses and the present continues .<br><br>

                the sentence in English should be this way: S + V + C<br>
                        ( Subject + Verb + compliment ) <br>
                    1.the subject : ( He, She, It, I, U, We.....)<br><br>

                    2.the verb ------- that is what the grammar all about:<br>
                        so as we said, all what we will use is the simple tenses and the P.C.<br>
                        2.1.the present simple:<br>
                            ( He, She, It..... or any single word or a name ) + the verb with an "s" + C<br>
                            ( I, U, We, they..... or any beg word) + the verb + C<br>
                            for example:<br>
                                catty speaks English really nice.<br>
                                We    speak  English really nise.<br>
                                Cars   run  so fast.<br>

                Oh it's a long way down <br>
                But if you don't look, you don't have to know it <br>
                And I can be around <br>
                To catch your fall if you're losing your grip

                And I swear that everyday you'll get better <br>
                You make me feel this way somehow
            </p>
            <p>
                But do you love me like I love you? <br>
                Don't have to rush if you don't want to <br>
                Oh I'll be patient <br>
                But just know that there's no way <br>
                That anybody else could love you like I love you
            </p>
            <p>
                All I need is a little love in my life <br>
                All I need is a little love in the dark <br>
                A little but I'm hoping it might kick start <br>
                Me and my broken heart <br>
                I need a little loving tonight <br>
                Hold me so I'm not falling apart <br>
                A little but I'm hoping it might kick start <br>
                Me and my broken heart
            </p>
            <p>
                I tried, to run away but your eyes <br>
                Tell me to stay oh why <br>
                Why do we call this love
            </p>
            <p>
                I need somebody to heal <br>
                Somebody to know <br>
                Somebody to have <br>
                Somebody to hold <br>
                It's easy to say <br>
                But it's never the same <br>
                I guess I kinda liked the way you numbed all the pain
            </p>
            <p>
                And you're not here <br>
                To get me through it all
            </p>
            <p>I was getting kinda used to being someone you loved</p>
            <p>Before I love you (nah, nah, nah) <br>
                I'm gonna leave you (nah, nah, nah) <br>
                Before I'm someone you leave behind <br>
                I'll break your heart so you don't break mine <br>
                Before I love you (nah, nah, nah) <br>
                I'm gonna leave you (nah, nah, nah) <br>
                Even if I'm not here to stay <br>
                I still want your heart
            </p>
            <p>
                So, before you go <br>
                Was there something I could've said to make your heart beat better? <br>
                If only I'd have known you had a storm to weather <br>
                So, before you go <br>
                Was there something I could've said to make it all stop hurting? <br>
                It kills me how your mind can make you feel so worthless <br>
                So, before you go
            </p>
            <p>
                Our every moment, I start to replay <br>
                But all I can think about is seeing that look on your face
            </p>
            <p>
                For as long as I live and as long as I love <br>
                I will never not think about you <br>
                You, mmm <br>
                I will never not think about you <br>
                From the moment I loved, I knew you were the one <br>
                And no matter what I-I do, ooh, mmm <br>
                I will never not think about you
            </p>

                You're the arrow through my heart <br>
                You, I'm nothing without you (oh, oh)

            <p>
                tonight when the stars <br>
                Light up my room <br>
                I sit by myself <br>
                Talking to the moon <br>
                Tryna get to you <br>
                In hopes you're on <br>
                The other side <br>
                Talking to me too <br>
                Or am I a fool <br>
                Who sits alone <br>
                Talking to the moon
            </p>
            <p>
                Voices always keeping me up <br>
                Telling me that I should give up
            </p>
            <p>Did I say something wrong? Did you hear what I was thinking? <br>
                Did I talk way too long when I told you all my feelings that night? <br>
                Is it you? Is it me? Did you find somebody better? <br>
                Someone who isn't me, 'cause I know that I was never your type
                Never really your type</p>
            <p>Every day we started fighting <br>
                Every night we fell in love <br>
                No one else could make me sadder <br>
                But no one else could lift me high above <br>
                I don't know what I was doin' <br>
                But suddenly we fell apart</p>
            <p>And I just wonder what it'd take to make you stay</p>
            <p>put ur hand in mine, <br>
                u know that i want to be with u all the time, <br>
                u know that i won't stop until i make u mine, <br>
                u know that i won't stop until i make u mine, <br>
                until i make u mine. <br>

                And you're making me feel like I'm loved by somebody</p>
            <p>You give me kind of love that I never had <br>
                Wish that I could love, love, love you back</p>
            <p>I don't wanna be sad forever <br>
                I don't wanna be sad no more <br>
                I don't wanna wake up and wonder <br>
                What the hell am I doing this for?</p>
            <p>And I know my life is better, Because you're a part of it, I know without you by my side <br>
                That I would be different <br>
                Thank you for all of your trust <br>
                Thank you for not giving up</p>
            <p>if u ever find ur self stocked in the middle of the sea , i'll sail the world to find u <br>
                if u ever find ur self lost in the dark & u can't see, i'll be the light to guide u</p>
            <p>Can't help but feel like something's wrong, yeah <br>
                'Cause the place I'm livin' in just doesn't feel like home</p>
            <p>Simple as can be <br>
                I got your hands in mine <br>
                And you don't have to listen carefully <br>
                I'll tell you a thousand times <br>
                Anything you feel, put it all on me <br>
                All of your thoughts, I want everything <br>
                And when you get sad, like you do sometimes <br>
                Put it all on me <br>
                Put it all on me</p>
            <p>I'll lift you when you're feeling low <br>
                I'll hold you when the night gets cold <br>
                You'll never have to be alone <br>
                And that's all you need to know <br>
                No love lost, we've got you and I <br>
                No clouds, we shoot them out the sky <br>
                You'll never have to be alone <br>
                And that's all you need to know <br>
                And that's all you need to know <br>
                And that's all you need to know</p>
            <p> And if the sun starts setting, the sky goes cold <br>
                Then if the clouds get heavy and start to fall <br>
                I really need somebody to call my own <br>
                I wanna be somebody to someone</p>
            <p>I just wanna talk about nothin' <br>
                With somebody that means somethin' <br>
                Spell the names of all our dreams and demons <br>
                For the times that I don't understand <br>
                Tell me what's the point of a moon like this <br>
                When I'm alone again <br>
                Can I run away to somewhere beautiful <br>
                Where nobody knows my name?</p>

                All surviving species survive because they can adapt to the environmental conditions in which they are found. For example, creatures living thousands of meters below the ocean can withstand tremendous pressures, but die when they rise to the water surface. The same is true for us. Mankind begins to exhibit anatomical changes in a spaceship with almost zero gravity on long spacewalks. Bones weaken or the digestive system is disturbed. And despite these, if they live in the same conditions for hundreds of years, either anatomy keeps up with this or the continuation of its species disappears day by day.
                So, what dangers could be waiting for people in a world where gravity is decreasing day by day?
                Could people who have been able to find a solution to just about anything for centuries have been able to overcome this problem?
                Or would this problem be the end of the people who destroyed the world?<br>
                People ... It was they who will open the door to all the disasters we have experienced and will experience in the near future. And it seemed that they were faced with a huge problem that would profoundly affect humanity and the whole living world. But maybe they might have a chance. There were a number of young people who managed to remain different from everything and everyone in a world where technology progressed and people did not fit the definition of 'human'. And these young people were willing to sacrifice everything to give life to the planet they lived in.<br>***<br>
                Grace and Richard… They were two people who were devoted to all humanity. They were among those who realized that the world was waiting for a great catastrophe, and this situation set them in motion. This duo, who spent time together for years, came together with people who had similar ideas with them in the following years. They all gathered together for a common purpose. They aimed to save humanity and establish a brand new world order. Because that society they were in made it compulsory for them to do this. Grace and Richard had done some work to stop the impending disaster. But because they needed more people, they included 4 more people in their group. Grace, Richard, Adrian, Victoria, Iris and Tom made a great team. First of all, Grace held a meeting to gather the whole team together. And he started transferring his plans to other members of the group. Grace first announced that she wanted to design a robot to make her work easier. But he said he needed a few people for design. Adrian and Victoria were involved in the speech and stated that they could help with the design and equipment of the robot. Tom said it would be a good idea to start a company by participating in the conversation. Everyone approved of Tom's opinion. After hours of succession, the meeting was over and many decisions had been made.<br>***<br>
                With the help of Adrian and Victoria, they managed to build a multifunctional robot called Yester. With the inclusion of Yester in their group, G.R.A.V.I.T.Y. They established a company called. There were two people responsible for this company: Tom and Iris. The rest of the group began to follow the gravity decreasing day by day, and as a result of research, they could predict that if they did not discover a substitute for gravity, all of humanity would be destroyed. Everyone was aware that nothing could ever be the same. Humankind, who has slaughtered and concreted nature for years and caused various pollution with the things they consume or use, would pay a great price for this damage. But Richard had an idea as usual. And now he had to share this idea he was thinking about with others. Richard told his friends: Gravity is essential for living life to survive, and otherwise imagine that there is no gravity. This situation will turn a good day into a disaster. Many things like cars, people furniture, pens and papers on the table need gravity to stay on the floor. Everything that is not tied to the ground has no reason to stay on the ground and begins to drift. Without gravity, not only vehicles such as furniture and cars will be dragged, but also the atmosphere, which is very important for our lives, and the waters in oceans, lakes and rivers will also be dragged in the air. In short, if we do not find a solution to the gravity that is decreasing day by day, nobody will survive. I have an idea that I can propose against this situation and that we will develop by thinking on it together. As a result of my research, it is possible to produce an artificial gravity in space. Of course, although the possibility of realization is high, it is only a possibility as a result. But friends, when we think of the dwindling time, maybe this may be our last chance to save humanity. We must start working so that it is not late for everything. First of all, I want Tom and Iris to stay in the world. Because the company, and in some cases, will need them too much. Me and the rest behindWe will go to the space station we built last year with the necessary equipment and we will start working to find an artificial gravity. I know we don't have much time. In other words, time will advance rapidly on earth while we are in space. That's why we have to hurry up guys.<br>***<br>
                Richard's speech was effective for everyone and the necessary preparations were made. The necessary equipment was provided by the company. Now everyone else, including Yester, was ready to take their first steps to save humanity. While everything was going well, the whole team was uneasy as a result of a notification to Iris. Great danger awaited them. Because there was a big company that wanted to neutralize them against this team. UMBRA company was suppressing and G.R.A.V.I.T.Y. He threatened them to give up what his company intended to do, but that was not enough to turn Richard away from his goal. He never returned from his decision. Gathering the team together after a while, Richard ordered Tom to launch them into space. On top of that, everyone got into the rocket and was launched to be sent into space. A life in which they would live under different conditions now awaited them.<br>***<br>
                A few days after arriving at the space station, the entire team went into a hard work to produce artificial gravity. First, they had to invent a large spacecraft with the help of Yester. In this way, artificial gravity would be produced and then Grace's plan would come into play. The entire team has managed to invent a sufficiently large and equipped spacecraft as it should be. And so it became easier for Richard to produce artificial gravity. Now it was time to build capsule-style houses where people could live without being dragged anywhere, as Grace had planned. And in order for humans to live without being dragged, Richard's artificial gravity had to be activated on these capsules. Despite going through the difficult process and their bodies getting tired, the team was very happy that they thought they had accomplished. The next day, artificial gravity was activated in the capsule-style houses built with Yester's help, and the team set out to return to their world days later with the joy of success. A difficult journey awaited them.<br>***<br>
                Richard and Grace were side by side. And they were different from most people on the team. Because there was a wonderful bond of friendship that held them together. They had made a promise to each other when they were little, and no one had separated them ever since. The reason is unknown, but perhaps all the things they worked on to save people were to keep each other out. Because neither Richard wanted to live without him, nor Grace… While they were in their thoughts, they suddenly met each other and smiled at each other. Perhaps with this smile to each other ‘We are now free. They wanted to say ‘. At that time, excited sounds of Tom and Iris were heard from the spacecraft's radio. Unfortunately, the sound was not very clear. Everyone realized that things were not going well. They came out of the spacecraft to spy around. And they tried to understand what was going on. Grace was the first to notice the rapidly approaching rocket on them. And shouting Richard, she preceded him. That day, the rocket destroyed the whole team, the inventions that had been worked on for years and most importantly, the hope of saving humanity. And it caused a huge explosion in space.<br>***<br>
                When it was learned that the company that launched the rocket was UMBRA, there was a great chaos around. G.R.A.V.I.T.Y. his company wanted to contact the team to take the necessary measures, but some things went wrong. And after a while, Tom and Iris commissioned a few people to get there to get the necessary information from space. A group of people who went to space to do the necessary research found themselves in a huge fog. And that's when they realized that all their hard work was wasted. It was inevitable that all humanity would now drift towards a bad end.<br>***<br>
                There was nothing people could not do for their own ambitions and interests. Although they knew that they would cause all of humanity to destroy them, their sense of competition had taken over them. And that would come at a very heavy price. And as long as the world was a planet dominated by wicked people, the human race would be doomed to extinction.
                MAYBE THE FATE OF HUMANITY,
                IT HAPPENED AS HE DESERVED ...<br>

                <img src="img/s2.png" class="headphoto">

                Hello guys, my name is Richard and this is my girlfriend Grace, we were so great together until THAT THING happened yesterday, <br>
                Grace and I were walking around hand in hand. Suddenly it started to rain heavily. But instead of waiting for the rain to end, we started dancing in the rain like crazy. Time really stood still while spending time with Grace. But at that moment, I realized that I had made a mistake about a subject, despite the very good memories that went through my mind.<br>
                while dancing and having so great time thinking of so great memories, a different kinda memory came to my mind, about that subject , something i did that Grace don't know, it was that day after i took a shower and Grace entered to have a shower too while i'm wearing my clothes, at that time i finished wearing my clothes fast and then i went to check my honey if she finished her shower that i get close to the bathroom and i realize that the door was kinda open, so of course i couldn't catch myself from looking , and slowly get close with my eyes from the opened door , and it was the first time i see my sexy cat naked oMG! , she was sooooo hot , and till now i was not strong enough to tell her that i saw , <br>
                I started laughing like an stupid thinking about this memory. Grace couldn't understand why I was laughing. But I guess laughter was contagious. She accompanied me with her radiant smile. We laughed. Maybe minutes, maybe hours.. Grace was the first woman to come into my life. And there would be no other. He touched my face with one hand. Grace began to stroke it gently. She reminded me of my mother being so caring. Grace was a wonderful person, just like my mother. I guess that's why they were having a good time together. Grace's curiosity must have piqued, so she asked why I was smiling so beautifully. After some thought, I decided to tell her about it. Her cheeks began to turn pink as I said this to her. I was in love with a really shy fairy girl. And it was driving me crazy. And I started getting closer and closer to her,<br>
                the closer and closer i get the more her cheeks turn red kinda pink, i started to be so red too, and then we kissed in that night soooooooo much that our lips turned the same color as our shy faces,  it was not cold anymore , even with the rain the weather was so hot,
                then my honey looked at me with those cute eyes of her and said in a cute voice "let's go watch a romantic movie together so we can kiss in the cinema when it gets dark...".<br>
                I said it wasn't a good idea to go to the movies because our clothes were so wet. And I invited Grace to my house to watch a movie together. She was a little shy at first. I think she was still embarrassed. I told him we would get sick if we got wet in the rain any more. And I think it made sense to Grace and she accepted my invitation. We hugged and went home. Because I didn't want it to get colder. When we got home I gave her some clothes to wear. She took my clothes. First, she sniffed the t-shirt with my scent on it. She looked really cute doing this. I think she really liked my scent. I gave her time to put on the clothes and asked her to open a movie while I got dressed. I always wanted movies to be chosen by her. Because I trusted her so much on this one. When I came in, I did not expect to meet Grace, who was waiting for me with a blanket in her hand and a blown out. She called me over and started the movie. The movie was romantic and very emotional. There were scenes where we both cried a lot. But it was time for a romantic scene. We met with Grace.She was looking really beautiful to me. I couldn't help myself and started kissing her. I guess I must have been a little too quick to stop myself when I saw Grace's bleeding lip. 
                Grace asked me: Will you suck my blood like a vampire now, my love?<br>
                i said "oh! is that ur blood i thought it's a strawberry milk that you're so sweet like this", i said that and i saw her so beautiful smile shinning as the sun in the winter, my feelings for her r so big that i can't describe how much i love her with only words and how much so gorgeous she is , i said "my heart, I LOVE U  so much, and i adore ur smile specially when u r so red like this " and then i kissed her soooo much again , she replied smiling saying "you are the reason of that smile, and I LOVE U so much tooooo(in a really cute voice)", we continued to watch the movie then while she is sleeping in my chest and my arm is around her <br>
                Grace was sleeping like a baby in my arms. Having him by my side made me the happiest man in the world. What should I do? I did not know. It was quite late. I didn't want to wake him either. I think it was the right decision to stay with me for this day. Being careful not to wake her, I got up and made a bed for Grace. It was time to carry her to that bed. I hugged him and carried her to bed. As I was about to put her to bed, she hugged me tighter and (before i go) only two words came out of her lips. 
                "Don't go"
                What I'm going to do now may not be right, but I wanted to do it. I wanted to hug my angel and fall into a peaceful sleep. I approached her and brought her back where he belonged. She was right on my heart. My heart was beating so fast. It was exciting to sleep with her. And sleeping with the girl I love was one of the best feelings in the world. I should have slept now. All I wanted was to wake up with her tomorrow. After I closed my eyes, I felt a soft kiss on my lips, but I couldn't be sure. And I slept. When I opened my eyes, I saw a pair of beautiful looking angels watching me. Grace's gaze was very deep. She was looking at me as if to say I love you. Grace parted her lips and said:
                You look more handsome when you wake up, Stupid. I smiled at her and kissed her forehead.<br>
                Grace looked so beautiful in my clothes. Would men's clothes suit a person that well? My eyes landed on the watch on my wrist. It was almost noon. However, while I was sleeping with Grace, I hadn't noticed how the clock had passed. We needed to eat something. I'm sure we were both very hungry. İt was so obvious. If it were up to me, I'd rather eat Grace, but I didn't want to tell her that and embarrass her even more. I took her by the hand and lifted her up. Maybe it was ridiculous, but like a child, I didn't want to leave her side even for a second. We even went to wash our faces together. Grace looking messy but gorgeous in front of the mirror it just fascinated me. We went to the kitchen to prepare breakfast together. Grace didn't like to eat too much in the morning. She usually drank coffee and placed something to eat next to her. I actually enjoyed spending time with him like a married couple. We prepared breakfast together for a while. More precisely, Grace prepared it. I watched her in a corner with admiration. 
    Unlike the heavy rain that fell yesterday, the weather was very sunny today. So Grace asked me to set the table on the balcony for breakfast. Upon his request, I went to the balcony and set the table. And I carried the plates there. Grace was really talented at cooking. Now it was time to have breakfast together. 
    I ate quietly for a while, looking into the eyes of the woman I love. While I was looking at the sky where the clouds looked like cotton with thoughts in my head, I noticed Grace trying to put honey in my mouth. I smiled. I watched her feed me honey bread. Then I grabbed her hand before she took it. And I kissed her hand. And finally, I added the following sentences.
    "Honey, you are my biggest dream in this world. And every second I spend with you I feel like I'm reborn. I love you so much my everything."
    Grace hugged Richard and told him how much she loved him...

    Grace and Richard, The two most deserving people in this world to be happy. I hope they hold each other tight like this for the rest of their lives and never part..<br>
